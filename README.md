# Attendance-System
👨‍💻 Using a Raspberry Pi 🥧, we set up an RFID reader 📡 to scan RFID tags/cards 🎫 for attendance tracking. When a tag is scanned, the system checks the unique ID against a database 📊. Attendance records are automatically updated ✅, providing a streamlined and efficient solution for managing attendance in schools 🏫, offices 🏢, and events 🎉.
